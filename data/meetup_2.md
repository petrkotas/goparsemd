## Program
### Talks
1) Peter Malina - What it takes to start with Kubernetes.
Kubernetes became one of todays big buzzwords. However, its extremely diverse feature-set makes it hard for teams to decide many times. I will give a brief information on where to start and how to decide what's important on the way to adopt Kubernetes.

Length: 30 min

Peter is a CTO of a Brno based software agency FlowUp. He is passionate about new technologies such as Kubernetes, Golang or Angular. Considering himself as a pioneer, he is constantly looking for new challenges.

2) Robert Zahradníček - Day 2 Operations
What happens after the application has been successfully deployed to its running environment? What involves running your cloud-native application? Which day-to-day tasks are required to keep your application humming? What lies beyond day 2? In this talk we will look into these questions and the accompanying topics, from application monitoring to backup/restore operations.

Robert is passionate DevOps enthusiast. He has been embracing DevOps for past 5 years. He first encountered Cloud Native world while working on SaaS platform for Brno startup ROI Hunter, where he worked on wide range of things like Ansible automation, continuos CI/CD pipelines, deployment of containers and migration to public cloud. His adventure continued in a German software company where he also lead both DevOps initiative and IT department in overall digital transformation of the company. Now he works in Red Hat Ansible team where he supports customers in their automation journey using Ansible and Ansible Tower products.
