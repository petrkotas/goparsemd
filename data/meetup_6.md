1) Vadim Rutkovsky - Istio

Istio is a new technology, which recently gained a lot of attention as cloud deployments grew from a few stateless pods to a large set of services with various versions and routing rules. In this talk I'll cover the idea of a service mesh, show the benefits of tracing requests and give some hints how Istio helps to improve security, observability and traffic management for the services in the cluster.

Vadim is a software engineer, working for Red Hat in OpenShift division. I'm interested in containers, cats, HA clusters and rubber ducks.

2) Robert Zahradníček - OpenTracing

In the world of asynchronous applications with intrinsic concurrency, the distributed tracing has become natural part of effective monitoring. When application grows to many distinct services however this becomes a tedious job. Setting up a distributed tracing can then add up to a sizeable project. In this talk we will look at OpenTracing standard and how it helps the effort. As well as explore how to put all this together in our demo application.

Robert is passionate DevOps enthusiast. He has been embracing DevOps for past 5 years. He first encountered Cloud Native world while working on SaaS platform for Brno startup ROI Hunter, where he worked on wide range of things like Ansible automation, continuos CI/CD pipelines, deployment of containers and migration to public cloud. His adventure continued in a German software company where he also lead both DevOps initiative and IT department in overall digital transformation of the company. Now he works in Red Hat Ansible team where he supports customers in their automation journey using Ansible and Ansible Tower products.
