This meetup is dedicated to lightning talks related to cloud.
Everyone is welcome to share his short talk. Some of popular
topics are:

* fuckups,
* wins,
* best new hype,
* hands on.

Besides lightning talks, this meetup theme is networking and
knowledge sharing. 

To have the discussion going on smoothly, we will provide
small food selection.

Come and meet new cloud friends, learn or share knowledge
and have fun.

Looking forward seeing you there.
